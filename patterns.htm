<h2>The Patterns</h2>
<p>There are quite a few websites out there with free patterns on them. I chose a few to highlight that I find myself using regularly.</p>
<h3>Pinterest</h3>
<p><a href='https://www.pinterest.com'>Pinterest</a> is a great source for cross-stitch patterns, some of which are free. They have a wide variety of patterns, 
ranging from vintage imagery to modern television and movie characters. Many patterns are uploaded directly to the site so you don&#39;t even need to 
download anything. You can just take a screenshot and save the pattern or save the pattern to one of your boards and come back to it. I&#39;ve also found 
many helpful stitch tutorials on Pinterest if you are interested in learning some fancy embroidery stitches to include in your work. You will need to create 
an account, which is completely free, in order to view these patterns and stitch tutorials.</p>
<h3>DMC</h3>
<p>DMC, a well-known craft supply company, also puts out many free patterns at 
<a href ='https://www.dmc.com/us/free-patterns-5041/free-patterns-5042/free-cross-stitch-patterns-5044.html'>dmc.com</a> . They have less of a variety than 
Pinterest, but they still have quite a few patterns that look very nice. The patterns cannot be snipped or saved like Pinterest allows you to do. They will 
show you an image of what the final product should look like, but not the actual pattern until you download it. You also need to give DMC your e-mail 
address before they will let you download these patterns, but they are a highly respected company with a good reputation and I have not had any problem 
using the site.</p>
<h3>Country Living</h3>
<p>The magazine <i>Country Living</i> offers some free cross-stitch patterns at its website 
<a href='https://www.countryliving.com/diy-crafts/a6380/cross-stitch/'>countryliving.com</a>. Like DMC, there is less variety with their patterns than a 
site like Pinterest has, but they are still nice patterns. These patterns have been in past issues of their magazine dating from 2015 to the current 
issue. Also like DMC, there is no snipping or saving these patterns. They will, however, show you an image of what the project should look like when 
finished. These patterns require you to download them, but <i>Country Living</i> is an esteemed publication, and I have not had any problems using 
the site.</p>
<h3>Make It Yourself</h3>
<p>As an alternative, you can create your own patterns. Sometimes the best way to do something creative is to just let yourself go. All you need is graph 
paper and good drawing skills. If your drawing skills need some work, you can find a picture you like and trace it onto the graph paper. If you create an 
original pattern that you really like, you can even consider putting it on Pinterest yourself or selling your pattern for a few extra dollars on Etsy.</p>
<h3>Books</h3>
<p>Although books usually aren't free, sometimes you can buy them secondhand and not pay a lot.</p>

<h3>Fabric Measurer</h3>
<p>Wondering how large your next project will be in inches? Please use the fabric measurer below to find out</p> 
</div>
<form id = "fabricMeasurer">
		<fieldset>
		<legend>Fabric Measurer</legend>
		<label for="fabric">
			What Count Is Your Fabric?
		</label><br>
		<input type="number" id="fabric" min='1'/><br>
        <label for="width">
            How Many Stitches Wide Is Your Design?
        </label><br>
        <input type="number" id="width" min='1'/><br>
		<label for="height">
			How Many Stitches High Is Your Design?
		</label><br>
		<input type="number" id="height" min='1'/><br>
		</fieldset>
        <button type="button" id="fabricButton">Do the Math!</button>
        <p>Width of Design in Inches:</p>
        <p id="inWidth">&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Height of Design in Inches:</p>
		<p id="inHeight">&nbsp;</p>
</form>
<script>
	function designSize() {
		var fabCount = document.getElementById("fabric").value;
		var numWide = document.getElementById("width").value;
		var numHigh = document.getElementById("height").value;
		var inWide = numWide / fabCount;
		var inHigh = numHigh / fabCount;
		document.getElementById("inWidth").innerHTML = inWide;
		document.getElementById("inHeight").innerHTML = inHigh;
	}
	var submitButton = document.getElementById("fabricButton");
	if (submitButton.addEventListener) {
		submitButton.addEventListener("click", designSize, false); }
	else if (submitButton.attachEvent) {
		submitButton.attachEvent("onclick", submitForm); }
