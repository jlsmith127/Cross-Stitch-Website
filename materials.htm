<h2>The Materials</h2>
<h3>Fabric</h3>
<p>To get started in cross-stitch, you will need a few items. The first we will talk about is fabric. The most common cross-stitch fabric is Aida. 
It comes woven into little boxes perfect for cross-stitching. It is available in many different counts which are based on the number of boxes per inch 
of fabric. It also comes in many different colors. You can also cross-stitch on linen, but you have to be careful with your stitches or they won&#39;t 
look as even as they do on Aida fabric.</p>
<h3>Threads and Needles</h3> 
<p>You will also need a needle and enough thread to complete your project. Embroidery floss is generally what is used for cross-stitching. The two main 
companies that make embroidery floss are Anchor and DMC. Embroidery floss comes in a variety of different colorsâ€”I&#39;ve even seen glow-in-the-dark and 
metallic embroidery floss. As far as needles go, a regular tapestry needle should work fine. All you need is a needle with a head small enough to go 
through the fabric without leaving an unsightly hole.</p>
<h3>Kits</h3>
<p>Crafting stores also sell kits that come with a needle, a piece of fabric already cut to the right size, and all the embroidery floss you should need to 
complete the project. They also come with a chart and instructions on how to do the project. These kits range from very small beginner designs to very big 
and very complicated designs. Some kits come with fabric with the design already stamped on it; you just have to stitch over their lines. Kits are perfect 
for someone who wants to try out a new hobby without investing a lot of money. In fact, my first cross-stitch project came from a kit.</p>
