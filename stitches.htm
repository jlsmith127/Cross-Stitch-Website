<h3>The Cross-Stitch</h3>
<p>One of the most important stitches in cross-stitching is the cross-stitch, hence the name. Bring your needle through the fabric at point A, making sure to
 leave a little tail of thread between half an inch and an inch on the wrong side of the fabric. Bring it back through the fabric at point B and pull until 
 the thread is taut. Your stitch is now half done. To finish it, bring your needle through the fabric at point C, and then bring it back through the fabric 
 at point D. Congratulations, you have completed your first cross-stitch. These stitches generally make up the body of your design, so you will get a lot of 
 practice with them.</p>

<h3>The Three-Quarter Cross-Stitch</h3>
<p>The three-quarter stitch is useful if you want your design to look less boxy and pixelated. It starts the same as a cross-stitch. First, bring your needle 
through the fabric at point A, making sure to leave a little tail of thread between half an inch and an inch on the wrong side of the fabric. Bring it back 
through the fabric at point B and pull until the thread is taut. Then bring your needle up at point C, and down again halfway between points A and B. 
This creates a diagonal stitch so that curves in your pattern actually look curved. You can start at any one of the four points if you want your stitch to go 
in a different direction.</p>

<div id = "backstitch">

<h3>The Backstitch</h3>
<p>Backstitches are probably the second most important stitch in cross-stitching. Bring your needle up through the fabric at point A, making sure to leave a 
little tail of thread between half an inch and an inch on the wrong side of the fabric, and bring your needle back through the fabric again at point B. Bring 
it back through the fabric at point C, and then down again at point B. You now know how to do a backstitch. These are often used for outlining and 
highlighting areas filled in with cross-stitches.</p>
